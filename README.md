# RSA Cryptosystem Implementation

This project is a Python-based implementation of the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm, designed primarily for educational purposes. It demonstrates the core concepts behind RSA cryptography, including key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.

## Background

The RSA algorithm is a cornerstone of modern cryptographic techniques. It's a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. Unlike symmetric key algorithms, which use the same key for both encryption and decryption, RSA employs a pair of keys â€” a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generates RSA key pairs suitable for encryption and decryption.
- **Encryption**: Allows for encrypting messages using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Enables the decryption of messages with the private key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python (version 3.x or newer) installed on your system to run this project.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theevilfly1234/RSA-cryptosystem.git
cd RSA-cryptosystem

No additional Python libraries or dependencies are required to run this project.

Usage

Key Generation
To generate a new RSA key pair, run:
python keygen.py <low_primes_range> <high_primes_range>
Replace <low_primes_range> and <high_primes_range> with the desired range for prime number selection.

Encryption

To encrypt a message using a generated public key:
python encrypt.py <public_key_n> <public_key_e>
Enter the message you wish to encrypt when prompted.

Decryption
To decrypt a message using your private key:
python decrypt.py <private_key_n> <private_key_d>
Input the encrypted message to retrieve the original content.
